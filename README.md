# email-sending-simulator

We work with **forms**, **read what the user writes and validation**. We focus on the **Front-end** part. If the email is empty the button will be disabled, once filled it is enabled. In the 'Para' field, to be valid, it must have the correct structure of an email. Once the 'Enviar' button has been completed and pressed, we will see a spinner that will simulate that the mail was sent, it will show us the alert and the form will be restarted. We also have the 'Reset Form' button that will iterate over the entire form and clean it completely.

## With this project we demonstrate:
* Manipulate the DOM.
* We know how to read data from a form.
* We add some functions, validations, etc.
